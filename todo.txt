add "oil sands" as new ore (http://www.oilsandsmagazine.com/technical/oilsands-101)
10 oil sands -> 2 bitumen (fluid) + 10 water + 5 silica sands (chem plant)
2 silica sands + 1 electronic circuit + 1 plastic = 1 advanced circuit (4s)
20 silica sands + 10 electronic circuits + 2 advanced circuit + 5 sulfuric acid = 1 processing unit (6s)
10 bitumen -> 6 heavy oil + 2 light oil (chem plant)
gravel floor (20% walking modifier)
vehicle acceleration for coal dust: 120% (change solid fuel to 140%)

UNCERTAIN 
- compatibility for martathon (make copper plates process slower in chemical plant)
- implement process for DyTech / bobs ore?
- purified iron/copper
- smelt copper plates?
- big miner (different output but a lot more?)
